# WebPage-Analysis

Lots of information can be gathered from a webpage to help with OSINT investigations. Here are a couple of scripts to help !

\# webpage-parse.sh - searches the webpage for links and email addresses<br>
\# get-headers.sh - grabs the http headers <br>
\# get-securitytxt.sh - grabs the info in the security.txt files and displays it on the command line
